# Welcome to the Neo4j Starter Kit contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our projects!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community friendly
and respectable.

In this guide you will get a brief overview of the contribution workflow from
opening an issue, creating a PR, the review process and the merge of a PR.

## Getting started

### Issues

If you have a bug to report or feature to request, first
[search to see if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).
If a related issue doesn't exist, please raise a [new issue](https://github.com/neo4j-examples/langchain-starter-kit/issues/new).

If you don't have a bug to report or feature request, but you need a hand with
the code; community support is available via [Neo4j Online Community](https://community.neo4j.com/)
and/or [Discord](https://discord.gg/neo4j).

### Make changes

1. Fork the respository.
3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Pull request

When you're finished with your changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

* Ensure that you have [signed the CLA](https://neo4j.com/developer/contributing-code/#sign-cla) for a non-trivial patch or pull request.
* Don't forget to [link your PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
if you are solving one.
* Try to resolve a issue in a single commit. Use [Squash and Merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits) on GitHub
* Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
so that maintainers can make any necessary tweaks and update your branch for merge.
* Reviewers may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using
[suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
or normal pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through
the UI, and any other changes can be made in your fork and committed to the PR branch.
* As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
